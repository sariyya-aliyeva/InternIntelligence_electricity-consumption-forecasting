# ⚡ Electricity Consumption Forecasting

This project was developed as part of my internship at **Intern Intelligence**.

Using historical hourly electricity consumption data from multiple US regions, I built a predictive model to forecast daily demand using the Prophet time series model.

## Steps:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (14 CSV + 1 Parquet file)
- Time series forecasting using Prophet
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- Visualization and reporting of insights

## Results:
- Best performing region: **NI_MW** (MAPE ≈ 3.8%)
- Most other regions achieved stable accuracy between 6–9%

## Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab

## Visualization
The visuals below show the model’s performance (MAPE comparison and forecast accuracy by region).
